0. TL;DR

The Shop Page is where customers browse and select products to purchase. It must display items pulled via Printful’s product catalog (variants, colors, mockups), support filtering/sorting, and integrate with Stripe so users can add to cart, checkout, and pay. It’s the gateway of the user’s purchase flow.

1. Executive Summary
1.1 Product Overview

The Shop Page is a core component of the storefront that allows users to view available Printful products, explore variants, evaluate price including estimated shipping, add to cart, and proceed to checkout. The page must tightly integrate with the Printful API for product data and with Stripe for payment processing.

1.2 Key Objectives

Accurate Product Representation — show up-to-date product info (variants, mockups, pricing) from Printful.

Good UX for Selection — easy filters (color, size), clear visuals, variant switching.

Transparent Pricing — product + estimated shipping + tax included or clearly displayed.

Smooth Cart & Checkout Flow — minimal friction from product selection → payment.

Reliability — handle edge cases where Printful might have missing mockups, variant restrictions, or out-of-stock, and where Stripe might have failures.

2. Goals, Context & Problem Statement
2.1 Goals & Objectives

Increase conversion rate from product view → purchase.

Reduce cart abandonment by showing total costs early.

Ensure product data and inventory reflect what Printful can fulfill.

Ensure payment process (via Stripe) is secure, quick, and trustworthy.

2.2 Background & Target Audience

Users who want to buy custom / print-on-demand products (apparel, merch, etc.).

Likely familiar with selecting variants etc., but may dislike surprises in cost or shipping.

Need trust signals: product mockups, images, return policy etc.

2.3 Problem Statement

Current storefront lacks a product listing page that syncs dynamically with Printful data + shows realistic total cost. Without this, customers may see wrong data, unexpected costs at checkout, which leads to distrust or cancellations.

3. Scope Definition
3.1 In Scope

Fetch product list (name, description, variant metadata, available colors/sizes, mockups) via Printful API.

Display products in grid/list view with variant previews.

Filtering and sorting (e.g. by category, price, popularity).

Product detail view: variant selection (size, color etc.), image gallery (mockups), design previews.

Estimation of shipping cost (live or via Printful shipping estimate API) before or during checkout.

Add to cart functionality.

Integration with Stripe to create checkout/payment: collect payment, handle success/failure webhooks.

Handle cases where product variant is unavailable or print file missing.

UI for showing pricing breakdown (product base price + shipping + tax).

3.2 Out of Scope (for version 1.0)

Custom design upload by customer (if you're only selling pre-designed products).

Advanced personalization (e.g. real-time preview for custom text).

Wishlist/favorites.

Subscription products.

Multi-currency support (unless essential).

Full returns/refunds UI (this might be partly handled outside of Shop Page).

4. Success Metrics & KPIs

Product view → add to cart rate (e.g. % of product detail visitors who add to cart) ≥ target X%.

Cart abandonment rate less than Y%.

Checkout success rate (Stripe payments) ≥ some benchmark.

Load time of Shop Page ≤ 2-3 seconds for initial load.

Accurate pricing estimates: shipping/tax deviation error < small margin.

Fewer customer complaints about wrong variant images or missing mockups.

5. Requirements
5.1 Functional Requirements
ID	Requirement
FR-1	Fetch product list via Printful API, including variants, mockups, pricing.
FR-2	Show product cards with image (mockup), name, base price.
FR-3	Filter & sort: category, price, variant attributes.
FR-4	Product detail page for each product: variant selection, image gallery, description.
FR-5	Estimate shipping cost for user’s location (or allow input of shipping address to estimate).
FR-6	Add to cart, manage cart (update quantities, remove items).
FR-7	Integrate Stripe:

Checkout session creation with total amount

Handle payment success/failure |
| FR-8 | Display price breakdown: product cost, variants, shipping, tax, total. |
| FR-9 | Display variant availability; disable or hide unavailable variants. |
| FR-10 | Graceful fallback for missing mockups/images. |

5.2 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: product page loads quickly; variant image switching responsive.

Reliability: robust error handling of Printful API outages or rate limits.

Security: communicate via HTTPS, validate all inputs, secure handling of payment flows.

Scalability: support many products and many concurrent users.

Accessibility: keyboard navigable, alt text for images, good contrast.

5.3 User Stories

As a guest user, I want to browse products so I can see what’s available before registering.

As a user, I want to filter by variant attributes (size, color) so I can quickly find what fits.

As a user, I want to see shipping cost estimate before checkout so there are no surprises.

As a user, I want to pay securely using Stripe so that my payment is trusted.

As a user, I want to know if a variant is out of stock so I don’t try adding it to cart.

5.4 Technical Requirements

Backend service to fetch Printful product catalog, cache as needed.

Use Printful’s shipping estimate API.

Stripe integration: likely using Stripe Checkout or Payment Intents API + webhooks.

Store sensitive data securely (API keys; do not expose Printful/Stripe secret keys on frontend).

Frontend should handle dynamic variant switching, image loading.

6. User Flows & Journeys
6.1 Primary User Flow: Browsing to Purchase

User lands on Shop Page.

User sees product grid.

Filters/sorts products.

User clicks on a product → detail view.

User picks variant (size, color).

User sees price + estimated shipping (based on location).

User clicks “Add to Cart”.

User proceeds to checkout → Stripe payment.

Payment success → order creation with Printful.

Confirm order to user.

6.2 Edge Cases & Error Handling

Variant selected is unexpectedly unavailable → show message / disable variant.

Mockup/image missing → show placeholder.

Printful API fails / slow → show loading spinners, possibly cached version.

Stripe payment fails/cancelled → show error, allow retry.

Shipping estimate outside expected bounds → warn user or fallback.

7. Design & UX Considerations

Clear product cards: image, title, price.

Hover effects / variant swatches on card preview.

Responsive layout: grid collapses nicely on mobile.

On product detail: large image gallery; swatches or dropdowns to choose variant; immediate update of image + price on variant change.

Display of shipping address input early (or detect via geolocation) to compute shipping.

Button states: disabled when no variant selected, or “out of stock”.

Clear call to action: “Add to Cart”, “Checkout”.

8. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Printful data stale / out of sync	Cache product data; regularly refresh; check availability at time of order
Unexpected shipping cost or tax surprises	Estimate shipping early; possibly include tax calculator or integrate with tax API
Stripe payment failures / fraud	Use Stripe’s built-in fraud tools; retry logic; clear error UI
Performance issues with many variants/images	Lazy load images; optimize mockups; CDN usage
UX confusion over variants	Use clear labels, disable unavailable options, show previews
9. Roadmap
Phase	Features
MVP (1.0)	Basic Shop page, product grid, product detail, variant selection, pricing + shipping estimate, Stripe checkout
Phase 2	Custom design upload, personalization, wishlist, improved filters, multi-currency, promotions/coupons
Phase 3	User reviews/ratings, more complex shipping rules, localization (language, region)

If you like, I can generate a version of this PRD tailored to your stack (Astro + whatever backend) with API endpoints and folder structure. Do you want that?
